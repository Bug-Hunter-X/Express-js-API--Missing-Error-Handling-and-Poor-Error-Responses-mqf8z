This repository demonstrates an example of improper error handling in an Express.js API and provides a solution.  The original code lacks checks for missing request data and doesn't return informative error messages to the client. The solution introduces improved error handling to ensure robustness and better user experience.  This is crucial for production-ready APIs to provide informative feedback and handle unexpected scenarios gracefully.
